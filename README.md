‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites
To run this project locally, you need the following installed:

Java Development Kit (JDK) 17+

Maven 3.6+

(Optional) An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

üöÄ Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to get your local environment set up.

1. Clone the Repository
Bash

git clone https://github.com/KailasVS666/Library-Management-System-LMS.git
cd Library-Management-System-LMS
2. Configure the Database
The application is currently configured to use an in-memory database (H2) for simplicity, as seen in src/main/resources/application.properties.

To use an external database (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL), update the properties file:

Properties

# Example for MySQL connection
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/lms_db
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update # Use 'create' for the first run
3. Build and Run the Application
Navigate to the project's root directory and use the Maven wrapper:

Bash

# Build the project (compiles and packages)
./mvnw clean package

# Run the application
java -jar target/library-management-system-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
Alternatively, you can run directly from your IDE.

4. Access the Application
The application will typically start on port 8080.

URL: http://localhost:8080/

üîí Default Credentials
The DataLoader.java file likely initializes some default roles and/or an admin user on startup to ensure you can log in immediately.

Role	Username	Password
Admin	[Check DataLoader.java or project documentation]	[Check DataLoader.java or project documentation]
User/Member	[Check DataLoader.java or project documentation]	[Check DataLoader.java or project documentation]
